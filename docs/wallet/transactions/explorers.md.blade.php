# Checking Block Explorers

If a blockchain is a highway of transactional records, from the very first to the most current, a block explorer is your Hollywood tour bus: the guide to every aspect of that highway as you travel through it.

Most people, when using a block explorer, are only doing so to confirm a transaction they have sent or are receiving, this, however, taps into a tiny fraction of the power contained within the explorer.

Block explorers can give anyone access to all the information contained within that blockchain. You can search every block that was ever created, see every transaction an address has conducted as well as a snapshot of the status of that network.
