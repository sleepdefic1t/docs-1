# ARK: Fees

Sending ARK transactions requires a network fee. These fees are awarded to forging Validators as an additional incentive for securing the ARK Public Network (APN). This fee varies by transaction type.

While you may select a slow, average, fast, or custom APN transaction fee, it's recommended to leave the fee set to 'Average' unless instructed to do otherwise (e.g. a Validator or online shop recommends a specific ARK fee). If the fee is too low, your transaction may fail and all funds and fees will remain in your wallet. If your fee is too high, you will have overpaid for your transaction.
