# Signing In to a Profile

After [creating](/docs/wallet/profiles/create) or [importing](/docs/wallet/profiles/import) a profile, your next step is to 'Sign In'.

## Getting Started

After creating or importing a profile, or any time when opening the Payvo Wallet afterward, you'll see the 'Sign In' page.

</div>

## Profiles without a Password

To sign in, click on your profile.

## With a Password

To sign in, click on your password-protected profile.

<div style="width: 500px; float: inherit; margin: auto">

</div>

You can then enter your profile's password. Enter your password and click the **'Sign In'** button.

</div>

<x-alert type="info">
To learn more about a profile's password requirements, visit the ['Password Settings'](/docs/wallet/profiles/settings/password#entering-a-password) page.
</x-alert>

<x-alert type="warning">
If you can't remember your profile's password, there is ***no*** way to recover it. You will need to [create a new profile](/docs/wallet/profiles/create) and [re-import your wallets](/docs/wallet/wallets/import).
</x-alert>

## Success

Congrats! You have successfully signed in to your profile!
