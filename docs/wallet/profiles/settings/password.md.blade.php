# Profile Settings: Password

A profile password is used when signing in, importing, or deleting your profile. This protects your accounts and portfolios from being viewed by others. This password is different than the encryption passwords associated with created or imported wallet recovery phrases.

**Don't** forget this password. Without it, you will lose access to your profile and subsequently need to restore your settings and wallets manually. Visit the Profile [Export](/docs/wallet/profiles/export) and [Import](/docs/wallet/profiles/import) pages to learn more about backing up and restoring a profile.
